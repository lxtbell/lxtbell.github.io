                The strengths and weaknesses my friends point out largely overlap with what I perceive of myself.
                Maybe the way I welcome feedback about myself from others helps me get a better understanding of myself.

            <h3>Strength</h3>

            <h4>Optimism</h4>
            <span>
                As my name indicates, which contains "happiness" and "laughter" in Chinese,
                I have a sanguine and optimistic personality and always perceive things from a bright side.
                My friends are willing to approach me when they feel frustrated as I can always shed light on their problems and light up their mood.
            </span>

            <br>

            <h4>Modesty</h4>
            <span>
                Friends agree that I'm open-minded.
                They say that I'm willing to listen to and carefully consider all kind of opinions and advices,
                including those opposing my approach or standpoint, and those pointing out my weaknesses and mistakes.
            </span>

            <h3>Weakness</h3>

            <h4>Forgetfulness</h4>
            <span>
                Friends quote my poor memory.
                They claim that I can easily forget something that I was told three days ago,
                or a person met last month.
                Well, I guess I rely on my smartphone and computer storage too much.
                They do sometimes get amazed by my memory of technical details, though.

                    <span>
                        Friends told me that I look jaded and listless when I didn't sleep for long enough.
                        That is certainly the case as I mentioned above about my personal weakness.
