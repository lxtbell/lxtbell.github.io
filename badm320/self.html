            <h3>Strength & Weakness</h3>
            <p>
                How can something be a strength and a weakness at the same time? You might ask. Well, it certainly can.
            </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-12 d-md-none d-block"><h4>Laziness</h4></div>

                        I'm particularly reluctant to perform repetitive work,
                        easily getting bored and not willing to continue after a while.
                        Instead, I often look for ways to simplify or automate the work.
                        That habit results in my creation of many methods and tools to free other people and myself from the labor.
                        It also leads me to the Computer Science profession,
                        with a particular interest in artificial intelligence.
                        On the other hand, I sometimes perform inefficiently or procrastinate on monotonous work if it can't be automated with a reasonable amount of time and effort.

                <div class="col-md-9 col-xs-12">
                    <span>
                        Though often hidden, a perfectionist inside me sometimes calls out.
                        As a result, occasionally I spend a significant amount of time tweaking some fine details of my work.
                        Such work is often regarded as of very high quality.
                        Meanwhile, the fine details don't often matter that much and I could have spent the precious time switching to another piece of work of greater importance.

                    <span>
                        I always attempt to figure out how and why everything works.
                        The curiosity is probably why I have a strong interest in science.
                        When time permits I can keep surfing Wikipedia for several hours.

                    <h4>Sleepiness</h4>
                    <span>
                        Unlike many of others of the same age who can work well into late night and get up early,
                        I always need a long and comforting sleep.
                        I can't think as fast and accurately when I'm tired,
                        and sometimes decide to return to the bed during the day.
