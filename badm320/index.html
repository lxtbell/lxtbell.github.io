                I'm a senior Computer Science student with a Business minor,
                now studying in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology as an exchange student.

            <h4>Features & Benefits</h4>
            <p>
                I'm an optimist. My friends say that I bring happiness and delight to the atmosphere.
                Furthermore, my friends entitled me as a "walking encyclopedia",
                as I'm knowledgeable enough to explain a variety of concepts and principles in daily life.
                I'm also an experienced landscape and portrait photographer.
                My friends often ask me to take photos when travelling as they find that my photos convey a sense of beauty and elegance.

            <h3>Strength & Weakness</h3>
            <p>
                How can something be a strength and a weakness at the same time? You might ask. Well, it certainly can.
            </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-12 d-md-none d-block"><h4>Laziness</h4></div>
                <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-12 d-md-block d-none"><h4 class="center">Laziness</h4></div>

                    <span>
                        I'm particularly reluctant to perform repetitive work,
                        easily getting bored and not willing to continue after a while.
                        Instead, I often look for ways to simplify or automate the work.
                        That habit results in my creation of many methods and tools to free other people and myself from the labor.
                        It also leads me to the Computer Science profession,
                        with a particular interest in artificial intelligence.
                        On the other hand, I sometimes perform inefficiently or procrastinate on monotonous work if it can't be automated with a reasonable amount of time and effort.

                    <span>
                        Though often hidden, a perfectionist inside me sometimes calls out.
                        As a result, occasionally I spend a significant amount of time tweaking some fine details of my work.
                        Such work is often regarded as of very high quality.
                        Meanwhile, the fine details don't often matter that much and I could have spent the precious time switching to another piece of work of greater importance.

                    <h4>Curiosity</h4>
                    <span>
                        I always attempt to figure out how and why everything works.
                        The curiosity is probably why I have a strong interest in science.
                        When time permits I can keep surfing Wikipedia for several hours.

                    <h4>Sleepiness</h4>
                    <span>
                        Unlike many of others of the same age who can work well into late night and get up early,
                        I always need a long and comforting sleep.
                        I can't think as fast and accurately when I'm tired,
                        and sometimes decide to return to the bed during the day.

            <h2>What Others Think of Me</h2>

            <span>
                The strengths and weaknesses my friends point out largely overlap with what I perceive of myself.
                Maybe the way I welcome feedback about myself from others helps me get a better understanding of myself.

            <h3>Strength</h3>

            <h4>Optimism</h4>
            <span>
                As my name indicates, which contains "happiness" and "laughter" in Chinese,
                I have a sanguine and optimistic personality and always perceive things from a bright side.
                My friends are willing to approach me when they feel frustrated as I can always shed light on their problems and light up their mood.
            </span>

            <br>

            <br>

            <h4>Modesty</h4>
            <span>
                Friends agree that I'm open-minded.
                They say that I'm willing to listen to and carefully consider all kind of opinions and advices,
                including those opposing my approach or standpoint, and those pointing out my weaknesses and mistakes.
            </span>

            <h3>Weakness</h3>

            <h4>Forgetfulness</h4>
            <span>
                Friends quote my poor memory.
                They claim that I can easily forget something that I was told three days ago,
                or a person met last month.
                Well, I guess I rely on my smartphone and computer storage too much.
                They do sometimes get amazed by my memory of technical details, though.

                        Friends told me that I look jaded and listless when I didn't sleep for long enough.
                        That is certainly the case as I mentioned above about my personal weakness.
